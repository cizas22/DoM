### google-java-format Plugin Installation

A
[google-java-format IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527)
is available from the plugin repository. To install it, go to your IDE's
settings and select the `Plugins` category. Click the `Marketplace` tab, search
for the `google-java-format` plugin, and click the `Install` button.

The plugin will be disabled by default. To enable it in the current project, go
to `File→Settings...→google-java-format Settings` (or `IntelliJ
IDEA→Preferences...→Other Settings→google-java-format Settings` on macOS) and
check the `Enable google-java-format` checkbox. (A notification will be
presented when you first open a project offering to do this for you.)

To enable it by default in new projects, use `File→Other Settings→Default
Settings...`.

When enabled, it will replace the normal `Reformat Code` action, which can be
triggered from the `Code` menu or with the Ctrl-Alt-L (by default) keyboard
shortcut.

The import ordering is not handled by this plugin, unfortunately. To fix the
import order, download the
[IntelliJ Java Google Style file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/intellij-java-google-style.xml)
and import it into File→Settings→Editor→Code Style.

Restart IDE.

To build it, you will need to download and unpack the latest (or recent) version of Maven (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
and put the `mvn` command on your path.
Then, you will need to install a Java 11 (or higher) JDK.
Run `mvn clean install` and Maven will compile your project.

How you run this code is up to you, but usually you would start by using an IDE like [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/), [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), or [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/ide/).

The Maven dependencies may lag behind the official releases a bit.

If you notice some problems with this setup, please open an issue.

# A couple of Maven commands

* `mvn compile`: it will just compile the code of your application and tell you if there are errors
* `mvn test`: it will compile the code of your application and your tests. It will then run your tests (if you wrote any) and let you know if some fails
* `mvn install`: it will do everything `mvn test` does and then if everything looks file it will install the library or the application into your local maven repository (typically under <USER FOLDER>/.m2). In this way you could use this library from other projects you want to build on the same machine
